## Introducing React

### Old School VS New School
- OLD: Multiple individual pages where each page get torn down and redrawn
- New: Single-Page Apps(SPA) where different views of an app are loaded and unloaded into the same pages

### Major issues with SPA
- Extra effort trying to keep data in sync with UI
- Manipulating DOM is really slow
- Working with HTML templates can be a pain

### React
- Facebook create a library called `React` based on their experience with single-page apps

### Benefits of using React
1. Automatic UI State Management
  - React takes care of all state management stuff
  - All you need to worry is: the final state of your UI

2. Lightning-fast DOM Manipulation
  - Since DOM modifications are really slow, React came up with an extremely fast virtual DOM
  - Does the least amount of DOM manipulation to update the UI

3. APIs to Create Truly Composable UIs
  - React core APIs make it easier to create smaller, self contained visual components

4. Visuals Defined Entirely in JavaScript
  - Combines HTML templating with Javascript in a same file
  - HTML-like syntax --`JSX` makes things even easier

5. Just the V in an MVC architecture
